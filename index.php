            <p>Universities can and should emerge as the forerunners of national development. A substantial revisit of our understanding and approach to higher education needs to change. Kathmandu University can point to recently-developed programs in mountain architecture, sustainable development, global health and ethno-musicology to prove our alignment with up and coming trends in education system. Joining them is Human Rights Education (HRE). </br>With it being more than 70 years since the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the emergence of human rights as universal primary concern of all, Kathmandu University looks forward to leading Human Rights Education in the country. Our School of Law, has been actively educating young minds about human rights since 2014. </br></p></div>

<p>
Each educated person should touch a few lives, do something good to somebody, and initiate transformation of stereotypes. HRE enables us to move forward along with furthering democracy, the rule of law, as well as the promotion of intercultural dialogue, social harmony and justice. Nepal is in dire need of such educated youths promoting equitable and sustainable growth in all social sectors. The role of academic sector in taking the lead for the realization of socio-economic rights, can and must significantly change the role of youths in the society.  </br>
In an effort to develop academic programs on human rights and make to it more contextual, Kathmandu University in cooperative support from Western Sydney University, is organizing this 10th Conference on HRE in Kathmandu. The series of conference on HRE began at WSU in 2010 under the leadership of Professor. Dr. Sev Ozdowski AM, President, Australian Council for Human Rights Education. Seven countries have already hosted this important event. Kathmandu University is at the forefront of hosting this conference in Nepal. This unique collaboration and partnership between WSU and KU supported by human rights friendly global community, academic institutions, civil society groups, international organizations will hopefully result into a new human rights dynamic that can respond to 21st century challenges.
</br>
The conference focuses on academic excellence, technology and artificial intelligence as the main theme supported by additional sub-themes that highlight on emerging challenges related to good governance, peace and social justice, global economy and SDG and Agenda 2030.  10th ICHRE as a forum will offer immense opportunities for assembling ideas and finding out practical solution for the benefit of humanity through open exchanges, deliberations and networking for fostering human rights for all. KU is pleased to host this event in cooperation with WSU, Government of Nepal and other partners. This conference has a special meaning for Nepal, as it is being organized on the eve of Visit Nepal Year 2020 and it is expected to offer all the participants an opportunity to enjoy the natural beauty, glorious culture and heritages that Nepal possesses which could benefit the world community.   
</br>   
I expect that this Conference will help boost human rights culture in Nepal and other participating countries, and present an option for all participants to view Kathmandu University and Nepal collectively as one of the forerunners in Human Rights Education in South Asia.</br>
I heartily welcome all participants to the conference. I wish your successful participation and enjoyable stay in Nepal.</br>
