      <p>
        In 2010, the 1st International Conference on Human Rights Education (ICHRE) was held in
Sydney, Australia. The conference examined the contribution of human rights education (HRE)
to furthering democracy, the rule of law, justice, and intercultural dialogue and social harmony.
This initiative has since evolved into a global grassroots movement with annual international
HRE conferences held in South Africa, Poland, Taiwan, USA, the Netherlands, Chile and
Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
        On 26-29 November 2018, ICHRE returns to Sydney, to Western Sydney University’s
Parramatta South campus.
      </p>
      <p>
        ICHRE will bring together around 400 Australian and international HRE experts, practitioners,
decision-makers and thought leaders from government, civil society, academia and the private
sector.
